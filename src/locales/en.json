Since I was a child I have been interested in understanding how things work and finding ways to improve them. Technology has always caught my attention, especially the way systems transform ideas into real solutions. Software development allows me to do exactly that, create tools that make people's lives easier and solve concrete problems.",
        "bio2": "I started my studies at ISIL in 2018 and at first concepts that today seem simple were confusing to me. With constant practice and the desire to understand every detail I managed to advance with more clarity. In 2021 I continued at USIL where I consolidated my knowledge by developing web pages, administrative systems and applications. During that time I worked as a Programmer Analyst at Lidera Software where I participated in the development of a complete enterprise accounting system with Angular and Spring Boot.",
        "bio3": "In 2023 I founded Code Resolutions, a freelance software development company where I offer personalized technological solutions to clients looking to bring their ideas to the digital world. In July 2025 I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Systems Engineering and I am currently working on my thesis to obtain my professional degree. Each project teaches me something new and brings me closer to creating solutions that truly add value.",
