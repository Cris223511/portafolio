                "description": "I worked on developing a complete enterprise accounting system with Angular 14 and Spring Boot. My main achievement was optimizing system performance by 40% through more efficient SQL queries and a clean layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository and Model.\n\nI was in charge of designing and implementing the REST APIs consumed by the different system modules. I used Spring Data JPA to manage data persistence in MySQL, which allowed efficient and scalable CRUD operations. On the frontend, I worked with HttpClient, Observables and RxJS to handle asynchronous requests and data flow between components.\n\nThe development process consisted of receiving detailed specifications in Word documents that included functional requirements, SQL queries, data models and design guidelines. From this, I created JPA entities, defined repositories with custom queries and exposed the necessary REST endpoints. Then, in Angular I consumed these services through GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests, dynamically integrating the data into the user interface.\n\nI was an active part of the agile team under the Scrum methodology. I participated in requirements analysis, data model design, dailies, sprint refinements, reviews and retrospectives. This constant collaboration allowed me to align technical development with business needs and deliver value features in each sprint.\n\nI applied design patterns such as MVC, DAO and DTO to keep the code organized and decoupled. I followed Clean Code and SOLID principles to ensure that the system was maintainable and extensible in the long term. Each module I developed met quality standards that facilitated its integration with the rest of the system.\n\nI managed version control with Git/GitHub, working on separate branches for each functionality and performing controlled merges. In addition, I prepared detailed technical documentation that allowed the team to understand the architecture, data flows and business logic implemented in each module.\n\nTech stack: Angular 14, TypeScript, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git/GitHub, Agile Methodologies (Scrum), MVC/DAO/DTO design patterns.",
